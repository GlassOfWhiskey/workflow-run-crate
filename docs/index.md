**Work in progress**

These are the working group pages for defining **Workflow Run Crate** -- a profile of [RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate) for capturing the provenance of an execution of a computational workflow.


## Community

This profile is managed by a working group of the [RO-Crate community](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/community.html)

We coordinate using the channel [#ro-crate on seek4science.slack.com](https://seek4science.slack.com/archives/C01LQQAAAS1) ([join](https://join.slack.com/t/seek4science/shared_invite/zt-csqh94qb-kf~kFbZxuHl1Hpxhbc8avw)) and the [RO-Crate mailing list](https://lists.elixir-europe.org/mailman/listinfo/ro-crate_elixir-europe.org).

**Co-chairs**: Simone Leo, Laura Rodriguez Navas

**Members**:
- Simone Leo
